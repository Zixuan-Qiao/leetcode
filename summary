Pay attention to:
uninitialized pointer (linked list)
dangling / wild pointer
memory leaking
boundary conditions
buffer overflow / index out of bound
range of a certain type
conversion between signed and unsigned number
using library containers on non-built in type may require customized comparison / hash functions
using loop to implement recursive function
creat a new list head to perform in-place operation
pay attention to the condition of moving pointers
library functions are slower

Techniques:
two pointers (Container With Most Water, Longest Substring Without Repeating, Two Sum, Three Sum, Remove Nth Node From End of List, Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
Manacher algorithm (Longest Palindromic Substring)
ascii to position array (Longest Substring Without Repeating)
strlen (Longest Substring Without Repeating, Similar String Groups)
union find (Similar String Groups)
graphs (Similar String Groups)
char to int(char - '0') (Letter Combinations of a Phone Number)
stack (Valid Parentheses)
p = p->next, then use p as the condition (Merge Two Sorted Lists)
recursive function, for branched generation (Generate Parentheses)
substr(start, len), find(str) (Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String)
