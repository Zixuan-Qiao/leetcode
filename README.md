2.	Dangling / wild pointer
3.	Memory leaking
4.	Boundary conditions
5.	Buffer overflow / index out of bound
6.	Range of a certain type
7.	Conversion between signed and unsigned number
8.	Using library containers on non-built-in type may require customized comparison / hash functions
9.	Use loop to implement recursive function
10.	Limits of int type, INT_MAX, INT_MIN
11.	Pay attention to the condition of moving pointers
12.	Library functions are slower
13.	Sequence of conditions connected by && and ||
14.	Strlen() does not include ‘\0’

## Techniques
1.	Two pointers (Container with Most Water, Longest Substring Without Repeating, Two Sum, Three Sum, Remove Nth Node from End of List, Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array, Median of Two Sorted Arrays, Trapping Rain Water)
2.	Manacher algorithm (Longest Palindromic Substring)
3.	Ascii to position array (Longest Substring Without Repeating)
4.	Strlen (Longest Substring Without Repeating, Similar String Groups, Reverse Words in a String)

6.	Graphs (Similar String Groups)
7.	Char to int (char - '0') (Letter Combinations of a Phone Number)
8.	Stack (Valid Parentheses)
9.	P = p->next, then use p as the condition (Merge Two Sorted Lists)
10.	Recursive function, for branched generation (Generate Parentheses)
11.	Substr(start, len), find(str) (Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String)
12.	Limits.h, INT_MAX, INT_MIN, shifting operators (Divide Two Integers)
13.	Extended binary search (Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array)
14.	Features and operations of sets and multisets (Valid Sudoku, Group Anagrams)
15.	Features and built-in function of list, str and dictionary in Python (Count and Say)
16.	Swap sorting based on index (First Missing Positive)
17.	Rotate matrix through flipping and transpose (Rotate Image)
18.	Handle near-limit range with divide and conquer (Pow(x, n))
19.	Traverse the sequence in reverse order (Reverse Words in a String)
20.	Record the position of the end of the last group (Reverse Nodes in k-Group)
21.	Create a new list head to perform in-place operation (Merge k Sorted Lists)
22.	Dynamic programming (Trapping Rain Water, Unique Paths, Climbing Stairs)
23.	Back tracking, record used items in array (Permutations)
24.	Push first item into result set with no condition as a start point (Group Anagrams)
25.	Kadane's algorithm (Maximum Subarray)
26.	Determine the traversal boundaries (Spiral Matrix)
27.	Find the crucial condition (Jump Game, Plus One)
